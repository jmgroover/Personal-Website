		<h1>Book Title: Silicon Valley Porn Star</h1>
    <h2>By Jason Portnoy</h2>
		<p>This is the story of Jason Portnoy's (ongoing) recovery from pornography and sex addiction.  It is especially interesting to me, as it is from a secular perspective, while most things I have read on this topic come from Christian authors.  Much of what he says rings true with me, although I don't think he takes it quite far enough in some respects.  Near the end, he talks about becoming more and more "spiritual", whatever that means to him.  This was still fairly recent however (the book ends in February 2022), so I still have hope that one day he will find the Lord.
		</p> 
    <p> I would like to add more thoughts to this, perhaps after reading it a second time.</p>
