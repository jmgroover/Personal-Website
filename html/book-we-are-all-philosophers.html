    <h1>We Are All Philosophers</h1>
		<h2> John M. Frame </h2>
		
		<p>This may have been my first real introduction to how philosophers actually think.  It was certainly interesting, and I certainly do not normally think like that.  I sometimes had trouble tying it back to the real world.  
		</p> 
		<p>His commentaries on how we should think about these things as Christians came across a bit... simplistic?  He basically just voiced an opinion on how we should think about the issues discussed, without giving too much of an argument for why we should think that way.  To be fair, he states in the introduction that this is supposed to be a simple book for high school or college students, and not an in depth treatise on the subject.  I understand he has written a much more lengthy treatise already, and this was intended to be a gentle introduction to the subject, so perhaps his simplicity or lack of depth in this regard is understandable.  I could also not find anything to disagree with, it just came across a bit shallow when reading it.
