			<h1>Welcome</h1>
			<p>Hello, my name is Jesse.  I have always thought it would be fun to have a website of my own, and have dabbled in the past, 
			but have not really put the time into learning all the HTML, CSS and Javascript necessary.  
			I am hoping to build this out more in the future.
			</p> 
			<p>I have a BS and a MS in Mechanical Engineering from UNCC, and enjoy playing around with (simple) programming projects, 
			basic analytical geometry, and anything else that catches my fancy.  I hope to add pages describing interesting
			things I am thinking about and playing with on my own time.
			</p>
			<p>I may also occasionally post pages containing thoughts on various scripture passages or books I have been reading. This is primarily
			to aid my own memory and comprension of what I am studying, but I hope it may eventually prove useful to someone else as well.
			</p>
			<p>Below is a picture of my family.</p>
